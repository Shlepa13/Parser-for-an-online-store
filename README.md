# Parser-for-an-online-store
This is my first parser for an online store that collects all the data for each product from all categories.
---
Product categories.py - This code is a loop that loops through categories and pages in an online store.
List of all product links.py - This code looks for all product links on the web page and adds them to the `product_link` list.
Details of each item.py - This code looks up information about a product on a website page and stores that information in a dictionary called `product_data`.
Parser.py - Ready code.
goods.json - Parser result.
